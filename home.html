    <h1>Parrot HTTP-IRC Gateway</h1>

    <p>I'm not a very smart IRC bot.</p>
    <p>My implementation is available on <a href="http://github.com/yannk/parrot-bot">GitHub</a></p>
    <p>I'm a HTTP-IRC gateway, to help the code communicate with its team owner.</p>
    <p>
    You can currently find me as {{.Nick}} on the current channels of {{.IrcAddress}}:
    <ul>
        {{range .Channels}}
        <li>{{.}}</li>
        {{end}}
    </ul>

<p>Here is how to make me send a message to a channel:
<pre>

# network address in this example is guessed from http-address command line argument: {{.HttpAddress}}
curl -XPOST {{.Url}}/post/ops -d "msg=INFO: Hello World, people of channel Ops"

 -or-

# entire payload is the message, just make sure Content-Type is not multipart or urlencoded
curl -XPOST {{.Url}}/post/chatter -H 'Content-Type:' -d "INFO: Awesomeness level 5"
</body>
